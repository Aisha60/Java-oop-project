# Java-oop-project
**Project Description**:
The current manual process is time-consuming, error-prone, and lacks transparency, resulting in conflicts and suboptimal utilization of rooms. This system aims to streamline the room scheduling process, reduce administrative workloads, and enhance the academic experience for students and faculty.

This desktop system includes features such as user registration and authentication, allowing different user roles for faculty, staff, and students.

For administrators, the system provides comprehensive room management capabilities. They can manage room information such as room types, capacity, and availability. This includes tasks like adding and deleting rooms, updating room information, and ensuring accuracy and timeliness of data. 

Room reservations are a key aspect of the system. Student and Faculty can create, update, and cancel reservations while ensuring they are made in accordance with room availability, thus avoiding scheduling conflicts. The system provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface to facilitate efficient time and resource management.

Overall, the Event Management System offers a user-friendly, efficient, and flexible solution for scheduling and managing rooms and events within the university. It aims to enhance productivity, reduce conflicts, and optimize resource utilization for a better academic experience.

This system is developed using java with gui (for login/signup only) in java swing library.
It utilizes basic oop concepts and good for learning.
